#' Filter rare response variables from the data
#'
#'@details This function allows you to remove response units (OTUs or SNPs or species) from your response data as a preprocessing step. Suitable when the response is a binary outcome.
#'@param X is a data.frame with rows as sites or individuals or populations and columns as loci or species OTUs.
#'@param lower is the lower threshold value  in which response varialkes are removed from the data.frame.
#'@param higher is the upper threshold value  in which response varialkes are removed from the data.frame.
#'@examples
#'\dontrun{ 
#' X <- filterRareCommon (Responsedata, lower=0.4, higher=0.7)}
#'@export
